## is_cached property


Gets a value indicating whether object's data is cached currently and no data reading is required.
Depending on the loading options only the necessary part of the data can be loaded into the cache from the image data.
In this case, we can use this property to determine that only part of the image data is loaded into the cache.

### Example 


Checks whether the object's data is currently cached, and if not, caches it.
### Definition:
```python
@property
def is_cached(self):
    ...
```
