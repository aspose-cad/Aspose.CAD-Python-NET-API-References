## index_of_refraction property


Gets or sets the index of refraction.

### Remarks 


The index of refraction (IOR) is a measured physical number usually in the range between 1 and 2
that determines how much the path of light is bent, or refracted, when entering a material.
It also influences the ratio between reflected and transmitted light, calculated from the Fresnel equations.




This property backs KHR_Materials_IOR extension.
### Definition:
```python
@property
def index_of_refraction(self):
    ...
@index_of_refraction.setter
def index_of_refraction(self, value):
    ...
```
