## alternate_write_file_name property


When set to a FileName or a relative File Path, it will be used to write the texture.

### Remarks 


When null, the default file name will be used.




if not sure about the image extension, using ".*" as extension will replace
the extension with the appropiate one before writing.
### Definition:

@property
def alternate_write_file_name(self):
    ...
