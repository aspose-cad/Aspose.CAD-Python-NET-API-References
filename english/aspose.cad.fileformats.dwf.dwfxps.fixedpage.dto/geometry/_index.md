## Geometry class

The geometry.
Geometries are used to build visual representations of geometric shapes.
The smallest atomic unit in a geometry is a segment.
Segments can be lines or curves.
One or more segments are combined into a path figure definition.
A path figure is a single shape comprised of continuous segments.
One or more path figures collectively define an entire path geometry.
A path geometry MAY define the fill algorithm to be used on the component path figures.



The Geometry type exposes the following members:

### Constructors
| Constructor | Description |
| :- | :- |
| [__init__](/cad/python-net/aspose.cad.fileformats.dwf.dwfxps.fixedpage.dto/geometry/__init__/#) | Constructs a new instance of Geometry |


### Properties
| Property | Description |
| :- | :- |
| [path_geometry](/cad/python-net/aspose.cad.fileformats.dwf.dwfxps.fixedpage.dto/geometry/path_geometry) | Gets or sets the path geometry.<br/>A PathGeometry element constitutes a complete geometry definition.<br/>A PathGeometry element contains a set of path figures specified either<br/>with the Figures attribute or with a child PathFigure element. |
