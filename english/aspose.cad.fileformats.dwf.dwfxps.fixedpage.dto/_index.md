### Classes
| Class | Description |
| :- | :- |
| [`ArcSegment`](/cad/python-net/aspose.cad.fileformats.dwf.dwfxps.fixedpage.dto/arcsegment) | The arc segment.<br/>Represents an elliptical arc between two points. |
| [`Brush`](/cad/python-net/aspose.cad.fileformats.dwf.dwfxps.fixedpage.dto/brush) | The brush.<br/>Brushes are used to paint the interior of the geometric shapes defined by a Path element<br/>and the characters rendered with a Glyphs element.<br/>They are also used to define the alpha transparency mask in the Canvas.OpacityMask,<br/>Path.OpacityMask, and Glyphs.OpacityMask property elements. |
| [`Canvas`](/cad/python-net/aspose.cad.fileformats.dwf.dwfxps.fixedpage.dto/canvas) | The canvas.<br/>The Canvas element groups elements together.<br/>Glyphs and Path elements can be grouped in a canvas in order to be identified as a unit(as a hyperlink destination)<br/>or to apply a composed property value to each child and ancestor element. |
| [`FixedPage`](/cad/python-net/aspose.cad.fileformats.dwf.dwfxps.fixedpage.dto/fixedpage) | The fixed page.<br/>The FixedPage element contains the contents of a page and is the root element of a FixedPage part.<br/>The fixed page contains the elements that together form the basis for all markings rendered on the page: Paths, Glyphs,<br/>and the optional Canvas grouping element. |
| [`FixedPageFileParser`](/cad/python-net/aspose.cad.fileformats.dwf.dwfxps.fixedpage.dto/fixedpagefileparser) | The fixed page file parser.<br/>Deserializes DTO objects from xml FixedPage file. |
| [`Geometry`](/cad/python-net/aspose.cad.fileformats.dwf.dwfxps.fixedpage.dto/geometry) | The geometry.<br/>Geometries are used to build visual representations of geometric shapes.<br/>The smallest atomic unit in a geometry is a segment.<br/>Segments can be lines or curves.<br/>One or more segments are combined into a path figure definition.<br/>A path figure is a single shape comprised of continuous segments.<br/>One or more path figures collectively define an entire path geometry.<br/>A path geometry MAY define the fill algorithm to be used on the component path figures. |
| [`Glyphs`](/cad/python-net/aspose.cad.fileformats.dwf.dwfxps.fixedpage.dto/glyphs) | The glyphs.<br/>The Glyphs element represents a run of uniformly-formatted text from a single font.<br/>It provides information necessary for accurate rendering and supports search<br/>and selection features in viewing consumers. |
