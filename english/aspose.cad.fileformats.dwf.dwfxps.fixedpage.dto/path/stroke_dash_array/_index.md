## stroke_dash_array property


Gets or sets the stroke dash array.
Specifies the length of dashes and gaps of the outline stroke.
These values are specified as multiples of the stroke thickness
as a space-separated list with an even number of non-negative values.
When a stroke is drawn, the dashes and gaps specified by these
values are repeated to cover the length of the stroke.
If this attribute is omitted, the stroke is drawn solid, without any gaps.
