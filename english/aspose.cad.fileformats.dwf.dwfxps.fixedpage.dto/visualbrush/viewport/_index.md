## viewport property


Gets or sets the viewport.
Specifies the region in the containing coordinate space of the prime brush tile that is
(possibly repeatedly) applied to fill the region to which the brush is applied.
Specifies four comma-separated real numbers(x, y, Width, Height), where width and height are non-negative.
The alignment of the brush pattern is controlled by adjusting the x and y values.
