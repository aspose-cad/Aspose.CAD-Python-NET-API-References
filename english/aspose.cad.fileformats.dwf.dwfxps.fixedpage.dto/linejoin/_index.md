## LineJoin enumeration

The line join.
Specifies the appearance of line joins.



The LineJoin type exposes the following members:

### Fields
| Field | Description |
| :- | :- |
| MITER | The miter.<br/>Indicates that the region to be filled includes the intersection of the strokes projected to infinity,<br/>and then clipped at a specific distance. The intersection of the strokes is clipped at<br/>a line perpendicular to the bisector of the angle between the strokes, at the distance<br/>equal to the stroke miter limit value multiplied by half the stroke thickness value. |
| BEVEL | The bevel.<br/>Indicates that the outer corner of the joined lines should be filled by enclosing<br/>the triangular region of the corner with a straight line between the outer corners of each stroke. |
| ROUND | The round.<br/>Indicates that the outer corner of the joined lines should be filled by enclosing<br/>the rounded region with its center point at the point of intersection between the<br/>two lines and a radius of one-half the stroke thickness value. |
